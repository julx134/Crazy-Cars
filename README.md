This Java project was made on June of 2017 within a one-month timeline as a culminating project.

It is an application of the main content learned from ICS4U. The game is built on the fundamental concepts such as OPP,
Inheritance, Classes, Lists, Methods and Graphics. Delta timer is also implemented which is not part of the curriculum but helped in
allocating more memory for the game.
